# CAS Platform Documentation

Purpose:
This repository contains high-level documentation of the CAS platform.
The goal is to provide a shared source of truth for humans and AI agents.

How to read:
1. Start with /01-platform/platform-overview.md
2. Then read /02-business-model/cas-business-model.md
3. Then read /03-user-cabinet/user-cabinet-overview.md

Scope:
- High-level platform structure
- Business model
- User-facing cabinet

Out of scope (for now):
- SDK technical details
- BI implementation
- Payments mechanics
- Publishing internals

Update rules:
- Prefer clarity over completeness
- Do not add details without explicit need
- Each document should stay at a single abstraction level
