# CAS Platform — Overview

Purpose:
Describe CAS as a platform from a top-level perspective.

What CAS is:
CAS is a platform connecting developers and publishers with monetization,
analytics, payments, and growth infrastructure.

Core idea:
CAS is not a single product but a platform composed of multiple subsystems
with different users and business roles.

High-level components:
- Business model layer
- User-facing cabinet
- Internal tooling (to be described later)
- Data & analytics (to be described later)

User types (high level):
- Developer (client)
- Publisher
- Internal CAS teams

Non-goals:
- No technical implementation details
- No KPI definitions
- No roadmap here
